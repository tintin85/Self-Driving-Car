## Self Driving Car

In this project I worked on a dataset of images taken by the forecam of a car, and the corresponding angles of the steering. I tried to predict the angle of the steering according to the forecam image with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. 

**Network Architecture**

The network architecture used in the proposed approach is inspired by [NVIDIA Corporation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf).
